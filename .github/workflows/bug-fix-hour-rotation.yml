            ## Instructions for triage
            
            - [ ] With the [Docs Content team calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_b6479d3fbfa96d03890f6523d7f7106553dc27573d1fbaa9d695ae903cb98bfd%40group.calendar.google.com), check whether the assignee is out of office for the week of ${{ env.TARGET_WEEK }}. 
               - If the assignee isn't available, assign this issue to the [next available rotation member](https://github.com/github/docs-content/blob/main/.github/workflows/enterprise-rhythm-bug-fix-hour.yml#L28). 
               - After you assign the issue to another rotation member, the rotation will continue from that member.
            - [ ] In the Enterprise focus area's project, adjust the "Cycle" field for this issue to the cycle containing the week of ${{ env.TARGET_WEEK }}.

            ## Instructions for assignee

            - [ ] If you're available during the specified week, reserve one hour on your calendar for fixing bugs. For more information, see [Completing a bug fix hour](https://github.com/github/docs-content/blob/main/focus-areas/enterprise/processes/bug-fixes.md#completing-a-bug-fix-hour).
            - [ ] If you're unavailable, coordinate a trade with another focus team member here or on Slack, then assign this issue to the writer who will complete the bug fix hour.
